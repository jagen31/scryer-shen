An experimental, very much in-progress implementation of the Shen programming language in Racket.

Unlike most other implementations of Shen, scryer-shen implements Shen directly in its host languages without bootstrapping it from a seed implementation of KLambda. The intention is to facilitate direct integration with [Scryer Prolog](http://github.com/mthom/scryer-prolog), a performant and feature-rich ISO Prolog system with powerful metaprogramming capabilities. More details to come.
